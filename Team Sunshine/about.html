<h3> What We Do</h3>
<p>Pediatric patients and their families can participate in volunteer-led programming provided by Project Sunshine in a number of medical settings. Whether a kid needs immediate or ongoing care, we are aware of the enormous responsibility that comes with managing their medical condition or injury. Since every child with a medical condition is different, our programs try to cater to their particular needs. <br>
<br>
Our mission is simple: <br>
To deliver the healing power of play to children with medical needs through trained and dedicated volunteers.<br>
<br>
We do this by connecting volunteers to pediatric patients and their families. For over 20 years, Project Sunshine volunteers have brought joy and play directly to pediatric patients at our network of hospitals and medical facility partners across the country through our in-person program, Here To Play.<br>
<br>
In 2020, the pandemic closed hospitals to outside visitors, and children became isolated. In support of our mission, Project Sunshine created the new TelePlay program, to continue to support patients and their families. This program brings play and activities to children via Zoom sessions with Project Sunshine volunteers.<br>
